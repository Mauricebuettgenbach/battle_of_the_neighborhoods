                "According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_restaurants), you can classify restaurants into seven categories that in turn can be broken down into eleven variations. Some of these combinations might be a little odd (e.g. \"Fine Dining\" and \"Pub\") but let us assume for a minute that this list is complete and all combinations are possible. In result, we would have 77 unique combinations of how a restaurant could look like. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cuisines) also hosts a list of cuisines and cuisine types. According to Wikipedia, there are five major cusine styles and 123 distinguished ethnic and religious cuisines, giving us 615  combinations for different types of food that we could eat. If we trust these figures, we are all in all looking at a possible variety of over 43,000 unique restaurants - great, right?\r\n",

                "Glad you asked! These figures do not really matter for our problem. I only wanted to show you one thing: The food industry is extremely diverse and each type of restaurant brings its own unique challenges. However, they all have one common issue: Location, location, location! No matter what type of restaurant you own, you need a specific location that matches your profile. Of course you could now say: \"That's easy to fix - just go where a lot of people are!\" \r\n",

                "But is it really so easy? Depending on your restaurant, you need parking space. Maybe you want a quite neighborhood because you own a fine dining restaurant. Maybe you don't want to be where a lot of other restaurants are that are similiar to the cuisine you offer. Or maybe you have a super trendy concept that requires your restaurant to be placed in the most hipster district of your city. We could make this list longer and longer but the point is: It ain't easy. \r\n",

Finding the right spot will require you to do some extensive research and location scouting. This process takes a lot of time and eats up ressources. While this approach is feasible for small businesses, it becomes unhandy for larger corporations who want to expand their restaurants to multiple cities at the same time. In result, corporations need to spend more money to keep up quality and speed. \r\n",

                " How? Well, with data science of course! Larger restaurant chains usually already have a couple of restaurants in place and know which locations run well in their business model and which not. We can use this information to train a clustering algorithm to identify neighborhoods that are similar to the locations with profitable restaurants. This way we can build a recommender system that tells us which neighborhoods in a new town are more likely to host a successful restaurant. Consequently, we would not have to research all areas but could focus our scouting activity on the most promising neighborhoods. This way, we would be able to improve speed and quality as well as cut the related costs significantly."

Now, each hexagon would receive a unique ID so that you could exactly tell what place on earth belongs to which hexagon. And finally, think of different layers of hexagons. Each layer is much smaller and more precise, enabling you to drill up and down on your map. That is exactly what H3 does - it provides you unique hexagons with different resolutions, all the way down to a precision of 0.0000009 kmÂ² area. \r\n",
